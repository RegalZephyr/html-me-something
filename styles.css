<p id="parttwo">Can't say that I actually suck at graphical design if I pretend it's ironic!</p>
<p>I mean, in reality, I kinda don't appreciate how we have to make two codes that rely on aesthetic sense when that shouldn't have anything to do with coding.</p>
<p>Because if we were to do this job in real life, presumably a person who knows graphical design would make the website, not someone who specializes strictly in coding.</p>
<p>But it is what it is, so here we go.</p>
<p id="partone"> Let's pretend we're not graphically crippled!</p>
