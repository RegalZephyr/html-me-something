<header>Let's Build Robots</header>

<main> 
<p> So hey, for whatever reason, you're like me and also like adorning your room in minaturized plastic giant robots. That's just fine. No problem with that. But for whatever reason, you want your own robots. Now you're getting into dangerous territory there, bub, but you gotta do what ya gotta do, y'know? Luckily, I happen to be a bit of an expert on the subject. </p>

<p> So, first problem you need to overcome is to acquire a robot. This may be harder than you think. Most of the robots worth building (in my own humble opinion) come from Japan, which is a heck of a way away. So, how do you solve this particular issue?</p>

<p> Well, turns out you've got options! The most convenient option would be to just go to your local hobby store that deals in this sort of stock. Then you just pick out a robot you want, hand it to the cashier, pay the money, then boom, you got a robot. </p>

<p> But if you're like me, who's either a social recluse or an idiot who can't check down every aisle when he's checking a store, then don't worry! There are plenty of reputable online dealers that deal with robots! Like Amazon!</p>

<p> Because Amazon tends to be my stomping grounds for picking these up, it might be useful to know some tips about them. </p>
<ol>
    <li>Be aware of your shippers! While most of the shippers are probably going to get you your kit 94 percent of the time, if the shipper is from Japan, you're probably going to be waiting for about a month for your plastic robot to arrive, which might just be too long for some people. </li>
    <li> Consider getting Amazon Prime. Three day delivery can be perfect for a robot building itch. </li>
    <li> Is a kit too expensive for your taste? Keep an eye on it! Amazon's prices are defined by their sellers, and prices can rise when the supply of a kit starts to dry up, but don't worry! If you stay patient, it'll probably fall down in price! But some robots won't see reprints, so be sure you know what you're looking for and how the robot's productions work out. A Gundam is a pretty safe bet to have a reproduction, for instance, if you just wait. An Armored Core? Regrettably, not so much. For reference, for a standard production High Grade Gundam model kit: Kit &#62; 20? That's probably too high.</li>

    <li> Did you just get the wrong robot? Don't fret! This might be a good thing! If you got it from a non-prime seller that's from Japan, you might get to keep the mistaken robot! Many sellers will find it's not worth the hassle to reclaim the kit. </li>
    <li> Limited edition robots can be hard to get as far as Amazon is concerned. When words like "limited edition" or "convention exclusive" get thrown around, prices can rise very quickly. If you have your heart set on the Hatsune Miku colored Gundam Deathscythe, you're going to want to be aware of when they're going to start selling, and get in on the ground floor!</li>
</ol>

<p> Now you've got your robot of choice, after a variable amount of driving and/or waiting. So now what? The first thing you're probably going to notice is that it's not built yet. That's probably normal. </p>
<p> As a 1/144 HG Barbatos Lupus is the closest thing sitting to me, let's use it as an example!</p>
