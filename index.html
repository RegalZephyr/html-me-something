<div class="intro">
<p> So hey, for whatever reason, you're like me and also like adorning your room in minaturized plastic giant robots. That's just fine. No problem with that. But for whatever reason, you want your own robots. Now you're getting into dangerous territory there, bub, but you gotta do what ya gotta do, y'know? Luckily, I happen to be a bit of an expert on the subject. </p>
</div>
<p> So, first problem you need to overcome is to acquire a robot. This may be harder than you think. Most of the robots worth building (in my own humble opinion) come from Japan, which is a heck of a way away. So, how do you solve this particular issue?</p>

<p> Well, turns out you've got options! The most convenient option would be to just go to your local hobby store that deals in this sort of stock. Then you just pick out a robot you want, hand it to the cashier, pay the money, then boom, you got a robot. </p>

<p> But if you're like me, who's either a social recluse or an idiot who can't check down every aisle when he's checking a store, then don't worry! There are plenty of reputable online dealers that deal with robots! Like Amazon!</p>

<p id= "listheader"> Because Amazon tends to be my stomping grounds for picking these up, it might be useful to know some tips about them. </p>
<ol>
    <li>Be aware of your shippers! While most of the shippers are probably going to get you your kit 94 percent of the time, if the shipper is from Japan, you're probably going to be waiting for about a month for your plastic robot to arrive, which might just be too long for some people. </li>
    <li> Consider getting Amazon Prime. Three day delivery can be perfect for a robot building itch. </li>
    <li> Is a kit too expensive for your taste? Keep an eye on it! Amazon's prices are defined by their sellers, and prices can rise when the supply of a kit starts to dry up, but don't worry! If you stay patient, it'll probably fall down in price! But some robots won't see reprints, so be sure you know what you're looking for and how the robot's productions work out. A Gundam is a pretty safe bet to have a reproduction, for instance, if you just wait. An Armored Core? Regrettably, not so much. For reference, for a standard production High Grade Gundam model kit: Kit &#62; 20? That's probably too high.</li>

    <li> Did you just get the wrong robot? Don't fret! This might be a good thing! If you got it from a non-prime seller that's from Japan, you might get to keep the mistaken robot! Many sellers will find it's not worth the hassle to reclaim the kit. </li>
    <li> Limited edition robots can be hard to get as far as Amazon is concerned. When words like "limited edition" or "convention exclusive" get thrown around, prices can rise very quickly. If you have your heart set on the 7/11 colored Unicorn Gundam, you're going to want to be aware of when they're going to start selling, and get in on the ground floor!</li>
</ol>

<h1> Let's build it! </h1>
<p> Now you've got your robot of choice, after a variable amount of driving and/or waiting. So now what? The first thing you're probably going to notice is that it's not built yet. That's probably normal. </p>
<p> As a 1/144 HG Barbatos Lupus is the closest thing sitting to me, let's use it as an example!</p>
<center><img src=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IyFhWcV00B4/WPBAT9HFItI/AAAAAAAGnrw/7BX6Xr6lnXYq3SjUFrD26vKjA13dzct8ACLcB/s1600/gundam-barbatos-lupus%2B%25281%2529.jpg></center>
<center> <p> Surprisingly to scale!</p> </center>
<p> So you're going to see an instruction booklet inside the box the robot came in. If no one's messed with the box, the instruction booklet should be on the bottom of the box.</p>
<p> If you've ever built a Bionicle before, then this should all appear familiar. However, as opposed to the parts all being in a bag that you have to fish out, the parts are instead melded into a plastic frame, and you have to individually remove parts from the frame to build with.</p>
<p> This presents both ups and downs. For one thing, the parts are all neatly labeled in either english or numerical symbols, so you can easily identify the parts, as opposed to having to look through a huge pile and picking something that looks like the picture in the instruction book. However, removing the plastic from the frame will leave an unsightly plume of plastic. This will have to be sanded down to look presentable.</p>
<p> After removing the parts, it's simply a matter of putting it together in the way the instructions indicate. Pay careful attention to the parts, and make sure you're doing everything in the correct order, however. Trying to take a section appart after you put it together can lead to you breaking parts, which will at best leave a part aesthetically damaged, and at worst, will make the kit impossible to complete. Unless you like not having a leg or something.</p>

<h1> Let's Pose! </h1>
<p> So now you've got a cool robot. But as you look at the pictures online, you realize that it doesn't look nearly as cool as the ones online. Have you made a mistake? Not precisely!</p>
<p> Chances are, if this is your first kit, that you put the kit in the stock-standard "standing straight, arms hanging down, accessory hanging down from their hands limply". So that's not gonna do!</p>
<p> The best idea would be to put it in a pose that implies movement happening soon. Poses that are mid-movement can look dull, given the robot probably is not moving any time soon. Not intentionally anyhow.</p>
<p> Poses that work well on most kits are ones such as preparing to fire a gun, having a large weapon hewn over their shoulder, or if you have stands available, preparing to take off or mid-flight.</p>
</article>
<h1> So now what?</h1>
<p id="partone"> Well, there are plenty of places you can go from here! Just for starting, you can try and paint the kit, which works just like painting anything else that's plastic. You could try and get other kits from the same line and take parts from one and put it in another to make a cooler kit. Among the cool kids who do stuff like this more than once, that's called "kit bashing". Some kits work better than others for kit bashing. For instance, the Armored Core line of kits are all made standardized with each other, meaning you can take an arm off of one and put it on another with very little fuss. Early Gundam figurines, meanwhile, have all sorts of different joints and balls and sockets, which can make it hard to put them with other kits.</p>
